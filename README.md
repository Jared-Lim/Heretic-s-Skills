# Heretic's Skills

Parser for that weird skills.js file  
According to results.txt, there are 11 variables, 12 if we count notes
>nameJP  
>nameEN  
>attribute  
>cost  
>power  
>hits  
>kuli (???)  
>hit  
>target  
>strengthen  
>effect  
>notes (apparently those 3 skills with notes have effect empty....)

I may just fix those 3 skills, but some skills have effects as empty so idk
